# Milestone v1.0: Smart Hedge System

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

This enhancement adds a multi-signal danger scoring system to the existing 99c capture strategy. The system tracks position state, calculates a weighted danger score from 5 signals, triggers hedges when danger exceeds threshold, and logs all decisions for analysis. Four phases build incrementally: tracking infrastructure, scoring engine, hedge execution, and observability.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Tracking Infrastructure

**Goal**: Bot tracks the state needed for danger score calculation
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: TRACK-01, TRACK-02, TRACK-03, CFG-03
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md - Add tracking infrastructure (constants, state fields, tracking logic)

**Success Criteria:**
1. When 99c capture fills, bot records the confidence at fill as peak confidence
2. Bot maintains rolling 5-second window of BTC prices for velocity calculation
3. window_state contains danger_score field (initially 0) when position is held
4. Velocity window size is configurable via constant (default 5 seconds)

### Phase 2: Danger Scoring Engine

**Goal**: Bot calculates danger score every tick when holding 99c position
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: SCORE-01, SCORE-02, SCORE-03, SCORE-04, SCORE-05, SCORE-06, CFG-01, CFG-02
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md - Add danger scoring constants, functions (get_price_velocity, calculate_danger_score), and main loop integration

**Success Criteria:**
1. Every tick while holding 99c position, a danger score (0.0-1.0) is calculated
2. Danger score incorporates all 5 signals: confidence drop, order book imbalance, price velocity, opponent ask, time decay
3. Each signal weight is configurable via constants
4. Danger threshold is configurable (default 0.40)

### Phase 3: Hedge Execution

**Goal**: Bot executes hedge orders when danger threshold is exceeded
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: HEDGE-01, HEDGE-02, HEDGE-03, HEDGE-04, HEDGE-05
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md - Replace confidence threshold with danger score trigger in check_99c_capture_hedge()

**Success Criteria:**
1. When danger score >= 0.40, bot places order to buy opposite side at market
2. Hedge shares equal original 99c capture fill shares
3. Hedge only triggers once per position (no double-hedging)
4. Hedge respects max price limit (opposite side ask < 50c)
5. Hedge uses existing place_and_verify_order() with retries

### Phase 4: Observability

**Goal**: All hedge decisions are logged with full signal breakdown
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: LOG-01, LOG-02, LOG-03
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md - Add danger score to Ticks, signal breakdown to hedge events, console D:X.XX display

**Success Criteria:**
1. Google Sheets Ticks tab includes danger_score column
2. Hedge events logged to Events tab with all 5 signal values
3. Console output shows danger score when holding 99c position

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Weighted score over multi-trigger (more nuanced, avoids unnecessary hedges from single false signals)
- 0.40 threshold (cautious given 97-98% win rate, can afford extra hedges)
- Buy opposite side to hedge (simpler than selling, guarantees locked-in loss amount)
- 5-second velocity window (long enough to smooth noise, short enough to catch rapid flips)
- Danger score uncapped (values >1.0 indicate very dangerous situations)
- Signal component pattern (each signal returns raw value and weighted component separately)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Market flips happening too fast for confidence-based threshold (13-15 seconds)
- Old 85% confidence threshold triggering too late
- Missing visibility into hedge decision factors

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
